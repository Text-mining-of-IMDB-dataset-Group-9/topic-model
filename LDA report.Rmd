## Analysis Report of IMDB data

#### Group 9: Lintong Li, Jiahao Liu, Zijia Wang, Kaiwei Xiao

#### **Introduction**

This is the report which is aimed at analyzing the most common words from IMDB reviews, and then trying to estimate the types of movies among these reviews.

#### Evaluation

First, we plot the distribution of term frequency which is larger than 0.1, and we found that there is a very long tail to the right of this novel which means existing those extremely rare words!

The idea of tf-idf is to find the important words for the content of each document by decreasing the weight for commonly used words and increasing the weight for words that are not used very much in a collection or corpus of documents. Calculating tf-idf attempts to find the words that are important (i.e., common) in a text, but not too common. From the tf_itf table, we know the top 10 words are trivialboring, cognac, smallville, sandra, blahblah, am√°lia, colombo, tarzan.

Then, From df table and networks visulization, we know the most common words are MOVIE, FILM, BAD, MOVIES, STORY, LOVE, FUNNY, TIME, WATCH, SERIES. We can guess the popular movies that people like from the above ten words. People are prone to watching story or series movies, such as Marvel movies. Additionally, we found that people also like to watch funny movies. The reason may be that people are busy today, and they prefer to watching the comedies to entertainment rather than the serious movies like documentary movies.

Finally, we do Latent Dirichlet allocation.
